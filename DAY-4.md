# **DAY-4 | JENKINS**

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that allows you to automate various tasks in your software development workflow, such as building, testing, and deploying applications. It provides a web-based interface and supports a wide range of plugins for integrating with different tools and technologies.

###  REAL WORLD SCENARIO  ###
Let's consider a real-world scenario where Jenkins is used in a typical software development workflow:

1. **Version Control**: Developers commit their code changes to a version control system like Git.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins is set up to monitor the version control system for changes. Whenever a new commit is made, Jenkins automatically triggers a build process.

3. **Build**: Jenkins checks out the latest code from the repository and performs a build process. This typically involves tasks such as compiling the code, running unit tests, and generating build artifacts.

4. **Automated Testing**: After the build is successful, Jenkins triggers automated tests. These tests can include unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and more, depending on the project's requirements.

5. **Code Quality Analysis**: Jenkins can integrate with code analysis tools like SonarQube or Checkstyle to perform static code analysis and generate reports on code quality, coding standards, and potential issues.

6. **Artifact Storage**: Jenkins archives the build artifacts, including compiled binaries, documentation, and other relevant files.

7. **Deployment**: Jenkins can deploy the built artifacts to various environments, such as staging or production servers. This can involve tasks like deploying to application servers, configuring databases, or setting up infrastructure.

8. **Notification and Reporting**: Jenkins sends notifications to relevant stakeholders, such as developers, testers, or project managers, about the build status, test results, and any issues encountered. It can also generate reports and metrics for monitoring and tracking the progress of the software development process.

9. **Continuous Deployment**: Jenkins can be configured to automate the deployment process to production environments based on predefined conditions and approvals. This ensures that code changes are seamlessly delivered to users without manual intervention.

10. **Monitoring and Scaling**: Jenkins can integrate with monitoring and alerting tools to track the performance and health of deployed applications. It can also scale the application infrastructure based on predefined rules or triggers.

11. **Scheduled Jobs**: Jenkins allows the scheduling of jobs for recurring tasks such as backups, database cleanups, or periodic maintenance tasks.

By leveraging Jenkins in this scenario, teams can achieve continuous integration, automated testing, code quality analysis, and streamlined deployment processes. Jenkins helps to automate repetitive tasks, ensure code stability, and improve collaboration among team members. Additionally, it provides visibility into the entire software development lifecycle, enabling efficient management and monitoring of the project.

4. In the "Build" section, click on "Add build step" and select "Execute shell" from the dropdown.
5. In the shell script section, enter the following commands:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Git checkout
git checkout <branch_name>

# Maven compile
mvn compile

# Maven package
mvn package

# Deploy to Tomcat
# Replace 'webapp.war' with your generated WAR file name and adjust the Tomcat server details
cp target/webapp.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/
```

6. Click on "Save" to save the job configuration.

### **Pipeline Job**

1. From the Jenkins dashboard, click on "New Item" to create a new job.
2. Enter a name for the job and select "Pipeline" as the job type.
3. In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section.
4. Choose the "Pipeline script" option and enter the following script:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  
  tools{
        jdk 'jdk11'
        maven 'maven3'
        }
  
  stages {
    stage('Git Checkout') {
      steps {
        // Git checkout
        git branch: '<branch_name>', url: '<git_repository_url>'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Maven Compile') {
      steps {
        // Maven compile
        sh 'mvn compile'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Maven Package') {
      steps {
        // Maven package
        sh 'mvn package'
      }
    }
    
    stage('Deploy to Tomcat') {
      steps {
        // Deploy to Tomcat
        sh 'cp target/webapp.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click on "Save" to save the job configuration.

### **Multibranch Job**

1. From the Jenkins dashboard, click on "New Item" to create a new job.
